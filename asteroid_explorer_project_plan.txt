Asteroid Close-Approach Explorer ‚Äî Project Plan

üéØ Project Goal
Build a beginner-friendly data science project that:
1. Pulls near-Earth asteroid data from NASA‚Äôs NeoWs API.
2. Explores the data with charts & summaries (EDA).
3. Trains a simple logistic regression classifier (optional) to predict the ‚ÄúPotentially Hazardous Asteroid‚Äù flag.
4. Ships an interactive Streamlit app showing insights.

This will give you hands-on experience with APIs, data wrangling, visualization, and a touch of ML.

üì¶ Deliverables
- Repository with:
  - /src ‚Üí data fetcher & helper utils
  - /notebooks ‚Üí EDA + ML exploration
  - /app ‚Üí Streamlit dashboard
  - requirements.txt, README.md (setup & usage)
- EDA outputs: histograms, scatter plots, top-10 closest asteroids table
- Optional ML report: AUROC/accuracy + feature importance (coefficients)
- Streamlit demo:
  - Date range input ‚Üí fetch ‚Üí charts & tables
  - Hazard classifier toggle (optional)
- One-pager summary PDF (project overview, visuals, key learnings)

üóìÔ∏è 2-Week Timeline (Sprint Style)

WEEK 1 ‚Äî Foundation & Exploration
Goals
- Stand up repo skeleton.
- Fetch and clean asteroid data.
- Run first round of EDA.

Tasks
- Init repo + requirements.txt.
- Write a fetch function using NASA NeoWs (7-day window).
- Store results in a DataFrame with fields: name, date, size_km, rel_vel_kps, miss_km, pha_flag.
- Notebook: explore distributions, plot size/speed, identify closest approaches.

Acceptance Criteria
- data/asteroids.csv with ‚â• 200 records.
- Notebook with:
  - size & velocity histograms
  - top-10 closest table
  - scatter plot (size vs miss distance)
- README with data source & setup instructions.

WEEK 2 ‚Äî ML + App Delivery
Goals
- Train tiny ML model (optional).
- Build Streamlit dashboard.
- Polish repo for showcase.

Tasks
- ML notebook: logistic regression on pha_flag, report accuracy + AUROC.
- Streamlit app:
  - Sidebar date picker + API key input.
  - Main: charts, top-10 table, scatter plot.
  - Extra tab: hazard classifier results.
- README update with screenshots.
- Export a one-pager summary (charts + bullets).

Acceptance Criteria
- Classifier AUROC ‚â• 0.7 on held-out set OR documented plan to improve.
- Streamlit app runs in <1 min on laptop, with successful API call.
- Repo is clean (no TODOs, clear instructions).
- One-pager PDF in /docs.

‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Constraints
- API limits: DEMO_KEY is rate-limited; encourage getting a free API key.
- Data gaps: Some days may have very few objects; document this.
- ML: Labels are imbalanced (most asteroids are safe). Address with class weighting or just frame it as exploratory.

‚úÖ Resume-Ready Bullets
- ‚ÄúBuilt an interactive dashboard using NASA NeoWs API to analyze near-Earth asteroids, including EDA and a logistic regression hazard classifier (AUROC ~0.7).‚Äù
- ‚ÄúDelivered insights via Streamlit app with visualizations of size, velocity, and closest approaches.‚Äù
